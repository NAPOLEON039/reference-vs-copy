    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // let age = 19;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    
    // age = 20;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    //the change in the original value doesn't affect the other because it is a copy not a reference

    //the same thing happens with strings
    // let name = 'Satoru';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // name = 'Rimuru';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // players[3] = 'Agil';
    
    // now here is the problem!
    
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array! And it goes both ways. Make changes to any array and it will
    //eventually go back to the original reference
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2, players);
    //if we pass index positions to slice, it will return a part of the array. If we don't pass it anything, it will give us a COPY of the original NOT a reference

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    //all the items in the iterable "players" wll be spread into the container which is an array

    //another way of doing the same thing is
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    //Aray.prototype.from converts any iterable to an array.

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team5[3] = 'Agil';

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 1000; //added new property to captain
    console.log(captain, person);

    //the new property has also been added to the original object since we have taken a reference to that object and not a copy

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    console.clear();
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 15 });
    console.log(cap2);
    //Object.prototype.assign takes a target object and the arguments following that are the new properties or changes to existing ones.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    //It's hereâœ¨ ALL HAIL THE OBJECT SPREAD!!!ðŸ™Œ

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const personalInfo = {
      name: 'Nihar',
      age: 19,
      social: {
        twitter: '@NAPOLEON_COC',
        github: 'NAPOLEON039'
      }
    }

    const personal1 = Object.assign({}, personalInfo);

    //On the outside this creates a seemingly good enough copy of the original object. But, it doesn't do that well of a job with the nested object.
    //Even the mighty Object spread can't help here ðŸ˜¥
    //The cloneDeep method is risky to use

    //Wes calls this the poor man's cloneDeep.
    const personal2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(personalInfo));

    //It's a quick and easy way to clone an object upto the deeper layers. However it may have performance issues since the original object is first converted to a string
    //and then it is parsed back into an object. It's then no longer a reference and becomes a proper copy.
